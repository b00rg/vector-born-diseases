# vector-born-diseases

Vector-borne diseases cause more than 700,000 deaths annually, and account for more than 17% of all infectious diseases. 

My project aims to use image recognition through Neural Networks to correctly identify harmful insects that may carry disease. 

Code is written in python using tensorflow, keras, numpy, skimage, and PIL libraries
